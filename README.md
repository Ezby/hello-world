# hello-world

Hi, humans!

I'm Korean.
My name is Yunah, but you can call me 'Ezabella', my English name.
My foreign teacher coined it for me.
It was from 'Isabella'.
I think mine is prettier to look and to listen.

I'm novice of coding.
My old brother has studied coding.
I was interested in it last year, but not enthusiastic.
This time, I'm going to study how to coding everyday, investing time, immersing a lot.

Glad to meet you!
